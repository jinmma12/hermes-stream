# Hermes Stream Roadmap

> Last updated: 2026-03-18
> Current priority: Integrity-first runtime hardening
> Current state: strong prototype, not yet production-trustworthy

---

## Vision

**Hermes Stream** is a lightweight data pipeline platform for operators who need:

- non-developer-friendly configuration from the web
- per-item provenance and execution history
- recipe/version management
- first-class replay and reprocessing
- NiFi-style observability without NiFi's operational weight

The long-term product direction remains:

- **.NET Engine** = runtime source of truth
- **Python API** = management/query facade and migration/reference layer
- **React UI** = operator console

That split is not optional. If runtime semantics live in Python tests/docs but not in
the .NET engine, Hermes will look more complete than it actually is.

---

## Product Truths

These are the rules that shape all roadmap decisions.

### 1. Integrity before breadth

Hermes is intended for real internal operational use. That means:

- duplicate collection behavior must be understood
- restart behavior must be deterministic
- retry and DLQ behavior must be explicit
- recipe snapshots must be reproducible
- replay/reprocess must be auditable

Adding more connectors before these guarantees are solid is a liability.

### 2. Runtime truth belongs to the .NET engine

The .NET engine must own:

- activation/deactivation semantics
- collect/process/export execution
- dedup/checkpointing
- retry/backoff/circuit breaker
- snapshot capture and replay
- provenance event generation
- cluster coordination and reassignment
- Kafka delivery semantics

Python may provide:

- CRUD APIs
- read/query APIs
- admin/auth/websocket façade
- migration parity tests
- plugin/reference utilities

### 3. Support level must be explicit

A connector or feature is only `Production-Ready` when it has:

1. deterministic restart behavior
2. explicit failure classification
3. metrics/logging/alert surfaces
4. integration tests against a real service or deterministic harness
5. documented operating limits

UI presence or mock-only coverage is not enough.

---

## Stage Model

| Stage | Purpose | Examples |
|---|---|---|
| **Collect** | Read or detect data from a source | File Watcher, FTP/SFTP, Kafka Consumer, REST API, DB Query |
| **Process** | Transform, validate, enrich, analyze, route | Transformer, Dedup, Router, Anomaly Detector |
| **Export** | Deliver to a destination | Kafka Producer, DB Writer, File Output, S3 Upload, Webhook |

---

## Support Levels

Hermes uses four support levels in this roadmap.

| Level | Meaning |
|---|---|
| **Production-Ready** | Integrity guarantees and real integration coverage exist |
| **Beta** | Functionally usable but still missing some operational guarantees |
| **Prototype** | Demo/reference quality, not yet safe for trusted workloads |
| **Planned** | Design intent only |

---

## What Is Actually Required for v1

Hermes does not need every connector category to be complete before it becomes useful.
It does need one coherent, trustworthy operating slice.

### v1 trustworthy slice

1. File Watcher Collect
2. FTP/SFTP Collect
3. Kafka Consumer Collect
4. REST API Collect
5. Basic Process chain
6. Kafka Producer Export
7. DB Writer Export
8. File Output Export
9. Replay/Reprocess
10. Provenance and monitoring

Everything else can come later.

---

## Current Assessment

### Strong

- product concept and differentiation
- UI direction and operator workflow thinking
- recipe/versioning model
- provenance/reprocess intent
- breadth of documented scenarios

### Weak

- runtime/documentation mismatch
- too much implied support from UI and docs
- insufficiently explicit support-level boundaries
- connector breadth outpacing integrity guarantees
- cluster claims ahead of runtime hardening
- Python reference layer still richer than some .NET runtime paths

### Immediate Risks

1. engine stub mode can hide missing runtime connectivity
2. FTP/SFTP dedup appears process-local instead of persisted
3. connector capability promises exceed current runtime enforcement
4. cluster failover semantics are not yet closed
5. mock-heavy tests can overstate runtime safety

---

## Phase 0: Design and Prototype Foundation ✅ COMPLETE

Delivered:

- architecture and collection design docs
- plugin protocol and initial runtime split
- Python prototype backend
- React operator UI
- .NET engine foundation
- pipeline/recipe/provenance domain model

Key outputs:

- `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`
- `docs/DATA_COLLECTION_DESIGN.md`
- `docs/TEST_STRATEGY.md`
- `docs/CLUSTER_DESIGN.md`
- `backend/`
- `engine/`

---

## Phase 1: Functional Prototype ✅ COMPLETE

Delivered:

- definitions, instances, pipelines, recipes
- activation and processing model
- initial collect/process/export flow
- reprocess model
- operator UI with pipeline and recipe surfaces
- initial built-in connector set

This phase proves the product idea.
It does **not** by itself prove operational trust.

---

## Phase 2: Integrity Track 🔥 CURRENT PRIORITY

This phase matters more than adding more connector count.

### 2A. Runtime Contract Hardening

- [ ] Mark `.NET Engine` as the runtime authority in docs and code comments
- [ ] Prevent production startup from silently using EngineClient stub mode
- [ ] Surface engine transport health in `/api/v1/health` and system status
- [ ] Define and document delivery guarantees per connector
- [ ] Define supported replay semantics per stage

Acceptance criteria:

1. A disconnected engine cannot look healthy in production mode
2. Runtime ownership of collect/process/export is documented and testable
3. Operator-facing health surfaces expose degraded transport state

### 2B. Checkpoint and Dedup Safety

- [ ] Persist monitor checkpoints outside process memory
- [ ] Persist dedup identity for collect sources
- [ ] Document dedup key strategy by source type
- [ ] Add restart recovery tests for file, FTP/SFTP, and Kafka
- [ ] Add replay tests proving no accidental recollect on restart

Acceptance criteria:

1. process restart does not blindly recollect already-accepted data
2. dedup key calculation is documented and asserted in tests
3. checkpoint ownership survives normal restarts

### 2C. Replay and Snapshot Correctness

- [ ] Verify execution snapshots are immutable and replay-safe
- [ ] Verify reprocess from step N reuses prior successful state correctly
- [ ] Verify `use_latest_recipe` and `use_original_recipe` behavior
- [ ] Add audit/log coverage for manual and bulk replay

Acceptance criteria:

1. replay intent is visible in DB and UI
2. snapshot hash changes only when config meaningfully changes
3. replay from later stages does not silently rerun earlier stages unless requested

### 2D. Failure Classification Framework

- [ ] Standardize error categories: transient, permanent, throttled, unknown
- [ ] Standardize retry policy contract by connector category
- [ ] Standardize DLQ payload and replay metadata
- [ ] Expose retry/DLQ counters in metrics

Acceptance criteria:

1. every connector failure path maps to a known class
2. DLQ entries preserve source identity and failure reason
3. retry behavior is deterministic and configurable

---

## Phase 3: Core Connectors to Production-Ready

This phase is about making the essential connectors safe enough to trust.

### 3A. Collect Connectors

| Connector | Target | Current | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| File Watcher | Production-Ready | Beta | Must close checkpoint/restart semantics |
| FTP/SFTP Collector | Production-Ready | Beta | Highest industrial priority |
| Kafka Consumer | Production-Ready | Beta | Must close offset, rebalance, replay semantics |
| REST API Collector | Production-Ready | Beta | Must close pagination/retry/idempotency behavior |
| Database Query / CDC | Beta | Prototype | Narrow scope before broad DB promise |

#### FTP/SFTP work

- [ ] host key verification and key-based auth support
- [ ] FTPS/TLS error handling and certificate behavior
- [ ] completion checks: marker-file and size-stable
- [ ] post-actions: keep/delete/move/rename
- [ ] persisted discovery state
- [ ] large directory traversal limits and safeguards
- [ ] real FTP/SFTP integration tests

Acceptance criteria:

1. restart-safe collection behavior
2. no silent duplicate collection after normal restart
3. real FTP and real SFTP integration coverage
4. documented handling for partial files, renamed files, deleted files

#### Kafka Consumer work

- [ ] explicit manual commit timing
- [ ] define default guarantee: at-least-once
- [ ] partition rebalance handling
- [ ] poison message strategy
- [ ] retry and DLQ behavior
- [ ] restart/resume tests
- [ ] real Kafka integration tests

Acceptance criteria:

1. commit point is explicit and tested
2. rebalance does not lose observability
3. poison messages do not deadlock the pipeline
4. duplicate handling strategy is documented

### 3B. Export Connectors

| Connector | Target | Current | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| File Output | Production-Ready | Beta | Needs stronger failure and idempotency guarantees |
| Kafka Producer | Production-Ready | Prototype | Must land in this phase |
| DB Writer | Production-Ready | Prototype | Narrow scope: PostgreSQL and SQL Server only |
| S3 Upload | Beta | Prototype | Useful, but not ahead of Kafka/DB |
| Webhook | Beta | Prototype | Useful after core export guarantees are clear |

#### Kafka Producer work

- [ ] keying and partition strategy
- [ ] acks and retry policy
- [ ] idempotent producer support where feasible
- [ ] ordering expectations documentation
- [ ] produce-failure visibility and metrics

Acceptance criteria:

1. operator can explain when a message is considered delivered
2. producer errors surface clearly in execution logs and metrics
3. retry and duplicate expectations are documented

#### DB Writer work

- [ ] insert/upsert modes
- [ ] schema mismatch classification
- [ ] transaction and rollback behavior
- [ ] deadlock retry behavior
- [ ] integration tests for PostgreSQL and SQL Server

Acceptance criteria:

1. upsert semantics are explicit
2. failure modes are observable and replayable
3. DB writer behavior is covered for both supported providers

---

## Phase 4: Operator UX and Trust Surfaces

Once runtime behavior is trustworthy, the UI can become a real operating console.

- [ ] support-level badges in UI: Production-Ready/Beta/Prototype
- [ ] connector capability pages with operating notes
- [ ] test-connection and preview behavior aligned with runtime reality
- [ ] replay UX showing original vs latest recipe clearly
- [ ] DLQ explorer and replay queue UX
- [ ] cluster health and connector health dashboards

Acceptance criteria:

1. UI does not imply unsupported runtime capability
2. operator can distinguish preview success from production runtime readiness
3. replay intent and connector support level are obvious

---

## Phase 5: Distributed Runtime

Distributed execution is important, but it must come after single-node integrity is real.

- [ ] coordinator/worker lease model
- [ ] split-brain prevention
- [ ] failover without duplicate collection
- [ ] checkpoint ownership transfer
- [ ] worker crash recovery for in-flight executions
- [ ] cluster-aware provenance and logs

Acceptance criteria:

1. coordinator failover does not create double collectors
2. worker crash does not orphan execution state invisibly
3. ownership transfer is observable and auditable

---

## Phase 6: Ecosystem and Enterprise Add-ons

- [ ] multi-tenancy
- [ ] plugin marketplace
- [ ] environment promotion
- [ ] Git-backed pipeline promotion
- [ ] documentation site
- [ ] CLI
- [ ] Terraform provider
- [ ] compliance/security hardening

These matter, but they are not more important than runtime integrity.

---

## Connector Acceptance Standard

No connector should be called `Production-Ready` until it passes all of the following.

### Required

1. configuration schema
2. test connection behavior
3. preview/discovery behavior
4. runtime execution path
5. explicit failure classification
6. retry or fail-fast policy
7. metrics/logging
8. restart behavior
9. replay/reprocess compatibility
10. real integration coverage or deterministic harness equivalent

### Source-specific requirements

#### Collect

1. dedup key strategy
2. checkpoint strategy
3. partial-read handling
4. source identity recorded in provenance

#### Process

1. deterministic step input/output summary
2. retry semantics
3. snapshot compatibility

#### Export

1. delivery success definition
2. duplicate tolerance or idempotency strategy
3. destination-side failure reporting

---

## Test Strategy Targets

The test goal is not just more tests. It is better trust calibration.

### Target mix

- unit tests for pure domain logic
- service tests for orchestration and snapshot behavior
- real integration tests for FTP/SFTP, Kafka, DB, and S3-compatible storage
- xfail contract tests for not-yet-closed operating behaviors
- soak tests for reconnect/retry/backpressure

### Required E2E contracts

1. operator creates and activates pipeline
2. source event creates one tracked work item
3. process/export success is visible in provenance
4. source or export failure enters retry/DLQ path visibly
5. replay from failed stage preserves audit history
6. restart resumes safely without silent duplication

See:

- `docs/CLAUDE_E2E_OPS_CONSULTING.md`
- `backend/tests/e2e/`
- `deploy/docker-compose.e2e.yml`

---

## What We Are Explicitly Not Doing Yet

These are intentionally not the current priority:

- connector count inflation for its own sake
- large cluster claims before single-node integrity is closed
- marketplace polish before runtime trust exists
- advanced enterprise features before core collect/process/export is trustworthy

---

## Development Workflow

### Branch policy

```
main
develop
feature/*
fix/*
test/*
docs/*
```

### PR checklist

```
□ runtime behavior matches docs/UI claims
□ tests added for the changed behavior
□ support level updated if capability changed
□ no silent fallback to stub/runtime bypass
□ restart/retry implications considered
□ ROADMAP.md updated if scope or support level changed
```

---

## Short-Term Execution Plan

### Next 2 weeks

1. block or expose stub mode in production
2. define persisted checkpoint and dedup strategy
3. close FTP/SFTP runtime gaps
4. define Kafka consumer commit semantics
5. land Kafka producer and DB writer MVP

### Next 4-6 weeks

1. real-service integration suite for FTP/SFTP/Kafka/PostgreSQL
2. replay/reprocess audit completion
3. support-level badges in docs and UI
4. restart and failover contract tests

### After that

1. operator UX refinement
2. cluster coordination hardening
3. broader connector ecosystem
