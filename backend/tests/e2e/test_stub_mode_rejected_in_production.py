"""E2E: Stub mode visibility — verify EngineClient stub mode is detectable.

Risk addressed: EngineClient silently falls back to stub mode when gRPC
is unavailable. Operators may think activation/reprocess succeeded when
only a stub response was returned.

These tests verify:
1. Stub mode is detectable via is_connected property
2. Stub responses are clearly marked with status='stub'
3. Callers have enough information to build a health check that surfaces degradation
